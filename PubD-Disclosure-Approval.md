_Bristol-Myers Squibb PubD disclosure information. Because the git
commit log and older file versions were not submitted for publication
approval, the public repository has been purged of history from points
prior to approval. Internal BMS users can still find the preceeding
history in repository `pgseqhash`, with the log-trimmed repository
under `pgseqhash-Published`_
