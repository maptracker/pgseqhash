### PG SeqHash Oligo Aligner

An oligo-to-genome alignment algorithm capable of exhaustively finding
imperfect matches in a large genomic database even with very short
oligos. Designed to aid prediction of potential off-target activity in
Anti-Sense Oligos (ASOs), where biological activity had been noted
even with two mismatches in an oligo aligning to an intronic region.
